# Implementation of simple calculator using Reason ML


This calculator app is made by me to learn `Reason ML` by exercising my muscle memory stick with its syntax and semantics. Most of the code that I have written is only rewritten of `elm` version of [chrisbuttery / elm-calculator] (https://github.com/chrisbuttery/elm-calculator), and css is implemented using [kalpeshsingh] (https: //codepen.io/kalpeshsingh/pen/wMNpLp).



Go and calculate with it!
[Reason-Calculator] (reason-fancy-calculator.surge.sh)

## How to start

`` shell`

$> git clone [this repo]
$> cd reason-calculator
$> yarn install
$> yarn start

`` `

## Impression

I impress by the similarity that `elm` and` reason` have in common like typing and architecture. (both have reducer by default!) This makes the translation between elm and reason quite easy.
